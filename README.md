    * Turbo mode has low initial speed and will accelerate to a higher top speed.
    * Supercharged mode has no acceleration at all but with medium base speed.

3. Player needs to move and avoid threats such as flying enemies, bouncing tires, and wrench throwers to reach a black and white checkered flag to beat the level/game.
